      <p>
        With my AP Degree in Computer Science I am able to quickly acquire new and relevant knowledge about programming languages, development tools and frameworks.
        On this basis a dream about working with development tasks as a programmer and solutions architecht has emerged.
        In addition, I have gained a lot of experience working in small agile teams, as well as planning, estimating and prioritizing tasks.
        I continued to apply these experiences in practice whilst I was an intern at Anybody Technology A/S.
        As an intern, I learned the importance of staying critical of what I produced, as estimates, diagrams and results were presented to the project manager and the customers.
        Furthermore I was able to utilize my experience from the service industry to create and maintain new relations.
